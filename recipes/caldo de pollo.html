  <h2>descripcion</h2>
  <p>The smoky, spicy, slow-cooked tomato chicken broth is made from scratch and the soup is topped with all your favorite fixings: toasted tortilla strips, sour cream, avocado, cilantro, lime, and crumbled Mexican cheese.</p>
  <h2>ingredientes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (4 1/2 pounds) whole chicken</li>
    <li>3 white onions, halved, divided</li>
    <li>2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Mexican oregano</li>
    <li>2 dried chili pods, seeds removed (optional)</li>
    <li>3 quarts of water</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>pasos</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine chicken, 1 onion, cilantro bunch stems, bay leaves, oregano, peppercorns, dried chile pods, and 3 quarts water in a large pot over medium-high heat. Bring to a simmer, lower heat to medium-low, and simmer for 1 hour.
    </li> 
    <li>Meanwhile, make the tortilla strips: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Cut the tortillas in half, then cut crosswise into 1/4-inch strips. Transfer tortilla strips to the prepared baking sheet and drizzle with oil. Add salt and toss well to coat, then spread the strips out as evenly as possible.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden and crisp, stirring once or twice during cooking time, about 30 minutes. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Carefully remove the chicken to a bowl. Reduce the heat of the broth to low.</li>
    <li>Let chicken sit until cool enough to remove meat. Shred chicken and refrigerate until needed.</li>
    <li> Add the bones, skin, and any scraps to the stock pot and simmer for about 4 hours total. If the broth reduces too much, just add a splash of water.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, after about 2 hours, prepare the charred vegetable dip: Preheat oven broiler to high heat and place a rack about 8 inches below the heating element. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly grease; Place the remaining 2 onions, tomatoes, sweet red pepper, and jalapeno pepper on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Grill the vegetables until charred, 7 to 10 minutes. Add the charred vegetables to a blender jar with the garlic cloves, chipotle chile, and 1 cup water, and blend until smooth.</li>
    <li>Pour the pureed sauce into the pot and increase the heat to medium-low. Simmer the broth for another 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Pour the soup through a fine-mesh strainer into a separate pot, squeezing the chicken to get all those nice juices; Discard bones and skin into a colander. Season the soup to taste with salt.</li>
    <li>Add cumin, shredded chicken, and juice of 1 lime. Simmer for 15 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Taste for seasoning and serve with crispy tortilla strips. Garnish with sour cream, avocado, chopped cilantro, grated or crumbled Mexican cheese, additional lime juice, and a pinch of cayenne, if desired</li>
  </ol>
