  <h2>descripcion</h2>
  <p>Hawaiian pizza is a pizza that contains a base of pomodoro sauce, melted mozzarella cheese and ham and pineapple as toppings.</p>
  <h2>ingredientes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pizza dough</li>
    <li>Fried tomato</li>
    <li>4 pineapple slices</li>
    <li>Grated cheese</li>
    <li>Oregano (optional)</li>
    <li>4 or 5 slices of cooked ham</li>
  </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>The first thing we will do is prepare the ingredients.</li>
      <li>To do this, we will cut the ham into pieces and cut the pineapple into cubes.</li>
      <li>Once this is done, we spread the dough for this Hawaiian pizza well, so that it has a uniform thickness. Once this is done, we spread the dough with fried tomato and then cover with the grated cheese.</li>
      <li> Now, we will distribute the cooked ham and pineapple on top.</li>
      <li> Whoever wants, at this moment, can sprinkle a little oregano. We place our pizza in the oven preheated to 240ÂºC, for approximately 12 minutes, or until the dough begins to turn golden brown.</li>
      <li> Once the baking time has elapsed, we take the Hawaiian pizza out of the oven, and we can now serve it and enjoy it.</li>
    </ol>
